                            projects.
                            This includes services for image processing, natural language processing, recommendations,
                            search, and much more.
                            What can we build with Azure Cognitive Services? Anything and everything!
                            We encourage you to think about how AI can address a user problem.
                            For example, how can you use AI to improve student life or day to day productivity?

                            Specifically, using records of historical energy consumption, approximate cost structure,
                            and details of different battery systems, identify customers who are the best candidates for
                            installing a battery system and build a business case to show them the benefits.
                            Additionally, investigate how such battery systems can reduce the impact on the environment
                            without reducing total energy consumption.
                            As a bonus challenge, recommend changes to the cost structure that would incentivize
                            increased battery deployments.
